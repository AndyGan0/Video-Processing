# Video-Processing
This project was created during my university's "MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS" course.<br>
Language: Python<br><br>

File 1a in folder "Folder "> "A" gets a video as input and performs lossless compression using Run Length Encoding.<br><br>

File 1b in folder "Folder "> "A" implements motion compensation on the input video and then it decodes it using Run Length Encoding<br><br>

File 2 detects a moving object in a video and makes it disappear using similar macroblocks from other frames.
